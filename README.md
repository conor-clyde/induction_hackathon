# Alchemy Insurance Chatbot – Graduate Hackathon 2023

This project was developed as part of my induction at Alchemy Technology Services during the 2023 Graduate Hackathon. The challenge: build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) "Quote and Buy" chatbot using Guidewire's Gosu language, capable of collecting customer data, processing insurance rules, and quoting a premium in real time.

## 🚀 Project Overview

**Goal:**  
Create a chatbot for Alchemy Insurance that collects customer, vehicle, and claims information, applies complex business rules, and provides an insurance quote (or declines) based on strict acceptance criteria.

**Context:**  
- First exposure to Guidewire and Gosu
- Built under time constraints as part of onboarding
- Two-day competitive hackathon: two teams (4 vs 4), demo to senior developers
- I stepped into a leadership role, organizing the team, delegating tasks based on each member’s strengths, and supporting less experienced teammates
- Our team delivered a complete, working solution—and won the competition
