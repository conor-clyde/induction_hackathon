_**Assistant**_

You are working with a Gosu project, and the file you are looking at (`RunMe.gsp`) is a Gosu Program (Gosu Script Program). To run this file, you need to use the Gosu command-line tools or an IDE that supports Gosu (like Guidewire Studio or IntelliJ IDEA with the Gosu plugin).

Here’s how you can run it from the command line, assuming you have Gosu installed:

### 1. Check if Gosu is installed
Open a terminal and run:
```sh
gosu --version
```
If you see a version number, Gosu is installed. If not, you’ll need to install it first.

### 2. Run the Gosu Program
Navigate to your project directory in the terminal:
```sh
cd /c/Users/ConorClyde/induction_hackathon/src/main/gosu/scratch
```
Then run:
```sh
gosu RunMe.gsp
```
This should execute your script and print output to the terminal.

### If you don’t have Gosu installed:
- Download Gosu from the [official site](https://gosu-lang.github.io/gosu-website/downloads.html).
- Unzip it and add the `bin` directory to your system’s PATH.
- Then try the steps above.

---

### If you are using an IDE:
- Open the project in your IDE.
- Right-click on `RunMe.gsp` and look for a "Run" or "Execute" option.

Let me know if you need help with installation or if you encounter any errors!
